# We know the last value in the list is in its correct position, so we never need to consider it again. The second time through the loop, we only need n-2 comparisons.

# As we correctly place more values, fewer elements need to be compared. An optimized version doesn’t make n^2-n comparisons, it does (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1 comparisons, which can be simplified to (n^2-n) / 2 comparisons.

# This is fewer than n^2-n comparisons but the algorithm still has a big O runtime of O(N^2).

# As the input, N, grows larger, the division by two has less significance. Big O considers inputs as they reach infinity so the higher order term N^2 completely dominates.

# We can’t make Bubble Sort better than O(N^2), but let’s take a look at the optimized code and compare iterations between implementations!

# We’re also taking advantage of parallel assignment in Python and abstracting away the swap() function!
